<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>
For this assignment,
you may work in pairs (2 people).
All students (whether working in a pair or not) must individually
turn in the assignment.
Therefore, 2 copies of the assignment will be turned in
for those working as a pair.
The grader will choose to grade only one copy of a pair's work,
and assign the same score to both students.
</p><p>
If one member of a pair does something unexpected with respect to turning 
in the assignment 
(for example: bad copy of the source code, late,  or perhaps not turning in 
portions of the assignment), 
then <i>both</i> of the pair get the same penalty and the same score.
</p><p>
If working in a pair, the names and sections of <i>both</i> students
must appear as comments at the top of all files of the turned in assignment.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this program is 
to further increase C programming skills,
working a lot more with pointers and again using a Makefile.
</p>
<p>
Please read this entire assignment specification before starting
on the first step.
</p>

<h3>Program Description</h3>


<p>
For this assignment, you will be given the structure for
a simple shared library that implements 
the memory allocation functions
<code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>.
Everything is present, except for the definitions of those
two functions, called <code>Mem_Alloc()</code> and <code>Mem_Free()</code>
in this library.
</p>

<h3> Step One: Understand the Code</h3>

<p>
Memory allocators have two distinct tasks. 
First, the memory allocator asks the operating system to expand the heap 
portion of the process's address space by calling either <code>sbrk()</code> or <code>mmap()</code>. 
Second, the memory allocator doles out this memory to the calling process. 
This involves managing a free list of memory and finding a contiguous chunk of 
memory that is large enough for the user's request; 
when the user later frees memory, it is added back to this list.
</p>
<p>
This memory allocator is usually provided as part of a standard library,
and it is not part of the OS. 
To be clear, the memory allocator operates entirely within the virtual address space
of a single process and knows nothing about which physical pages have been 
allocated to this process or the mapping from logical addresses to physical addresses.
</p>
<p>
Classic <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> are defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>void *malloc(size_t size)</code>: 
<code>malloc()</code> allocates <code>size</code> bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. 
The memory is not cleared.
</li>
<li>
<code>void free(void *ptr)</code>: 
<code>free()</code> frees the memory space pointed to by <code>ptr</code>, 
which must have been returned by a previous call to <code>malloc()</code> (or <code>calloc()</code> or <code>realloc()</code>). 
Otherwise, or if <code>free(ptr)</code> has already been called before, 
undefined behaviour occurs. If <code>ptr</code> is <code>NULL</code>, no operation is performed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p>
<p>
The source code files you will need are in the directory:
</p>
<pre>   /p/course/cs354-common/public/html/alloc.program/
</pre>
<p>
Copy the files <code>Makefile</code>, <code>mem.c</code> and <code>mem.h</code>
to your own directory.
You will probably copy more files for Step 3, but these 3 are sufficient for this step.
In <code>mem.c</code> is fully working code for two functions:
<code>Mem_Init()</code> and <code>Mem_Dump()</code>.
Look at them, and understand what they do, as well as how they accomplish
their task.
</p>
<p>
<code>Mem_Init()</code> sets up and initializes the heap space that this
module manages.
</p>
<p>
<code>Mem_Dump()</code> is used for debugging; it prints a list of
all the memory blocks (both free and allocated).
It will be incredibly useful to you when you are trying to determine if
your code works properly.
As a programming note: take notice of this function.
In the future, when you are working on implementing a complex program,
a function like this that produces lots of useful information about a
data structure can be well worth the time you might spend implementing it.
</p>

<h3> Step Two: Write the Code</h3>
<p> 
<b>Note: Do <i>not</i> change the interface.  Do not change anything within
file <code>mem.h</code>.  Do not change any part of functions <code>Mem_Init()</code> 
or <code>Mem_Dump()</code>.</b>
</p>
<p> 
Write the code to implement <code>Mem_Alloc()</code>  and <code>Mem_Free()</code>.
Use a <b>first fit</b> algorithm.
When freeing memory, always coalesce.
Use the linked list structure as defined and described in <code>mem.c</code>
for your data structure; it is the one described in your textbook in
section 9.9.6, and it is a bit different than the variation described in class.
Here are definitions for the functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>void *Mem_Alloc(int size)</code>: 
<br><code>Mem_Alloc()</code> is similar to the library function <code>malloc()</code>. 
<code>Mem_Alloc</code> takes as an input parameter the <code>size</code> in bytes 
of the object to be allocated,
and it returns a pointer to the start of that object.
The function returns <code>NULL</code> if there is not enough contiguous free space 
within <code>sizeOfRegion</code> allocated by <code>Mem_Init</code> 
to satisfy this request. 
For better performance, 
<code>Mem_Alloc()</code> is to return 4-byte aligned chunks of memory. 
For example if a user requests 1 byte of memory, 
the <code>Mem_Alloc()</code> implementation should return 4 bytes of memory,
so that the next free block will also be 4-byte aligned.
To debug whether you return 4-byte aligned pointers, 
you could print the pointer this way:
<code><pre>   printf("%08x", ptr) .
</pre></code>

The last digit should be a multiple of 4 (that is, 0, 4, 8, or C).
For example, b7b2c04c is okay, and b7b2c043 is <i>not</i> okay.
</li>
<li>
<code>int Mem_Free(void *ptr)</code>: 
<br><code>Mem_Free()</code> frees the memory object that <code>ptr</code> points to. 
Just like with the standard <code>free()</code>, 
if <code>ptr</code> is <code>NULL</code>, then no operation is performed. 
The function returns 0 on success and -1 if 
the <code>ptr</code> was not allocated by <code>Mem_Alloc()</code>. 
If <code>ptr</code> is <code>NULL</code>, also return -1.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Step Three: Test the Code</h3>
<p>
To test your code, compile it into a shared library using the
provided Makefile.
</p>
<p>
You will then need to write a separate program that links in and makes
calls to the functions in this shared library.
To help you do this, there are several sample programs and a Makefile within the directory
</p>
<pre>   /p/course/cs354-common/public/html/alloc.program/tests
</pre>
<p>
In this directory, file <code>testlist.txt</code> contains a list
of the tests we are giving you to help you start testing your code.
The tests are ordered by difficulty. 
Please note that these tests are not sufficient or complete for
testing your code; 
they are meant to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
To link with your library, you specify the base name of the library with 
the option <code>-lmem</code> and the path, 
so that the linker can find the library "-L.".
</p><pre>gcc mymain.c -lmem -L. -o myprogram -m32
</pre>

A form of this command is in the Makefile in the <code>tests/</code> directory.
Before you run the created dynamically linked executable <code>myprogram</code>,
you will need to set the environment variable, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>,
so that the system can find your library at run time.
Assuming you always run <code>myprogram</code> from (your copy of) 
this same <code>tests/</code>
directory, 
and the dynamically linked library (the <code>.so</code> file) is
one level up,
that directory (to a Linux shell) is '..', so you can use the command:

<pre>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:..
</pre>

Or, if you use bash shell:
<pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.. 
</pre>


If the setenv command returns an error "LD_LIBRARY_PATH: Undefined variable", 
do not panic. 
The error implies that your shell has not defined the environment variable. 
In this case, run:

<pre>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ..
</pre>

<p></p>

<h3>Handing In the Assignment</h3>

<p>Turn in file <code>mem.c</code>.
Copy this file into your handin directory. 
Your handin directory for this project is 
<br><code>/p/course/cs354-common/public/fall13.handin/login/p5</code> 
<br>where <code>login</code> is your login. 

</p><h3>Requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Within the comment block at the top of <code>mem.c</code>,
add a new line of the form: 
<pre>  * MODIFIED BY:  name, section#, partnername, section#
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Your program is to continue the style of the code
already in the file.
Use the same types of comments, and use tabs/spaces as the existing
code does. 
</li>
<li>
Document your added functions with inline comments!
</li>
<li>
Use the <b>mumble</b> Linux machines for this assignment!
A penalty will be imposed for any program that was obviously edited
on a Windows machine and transferred to the Unix machines
for turning in.
We are annoyed when we see Windows line endings (^M) at the
end of every line, so we take off points.
</li>
<li>
Your programs must compile
on a <b>mumble</b> Linux machine as indicated in this specification
<i>without warnings or errors</i>.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Do <i>not</i> use any <code>stdlib</code> allocate or free functions 
in this program!
</b>
The penalty for using <code>malloc()</code> (or friends) will be
no credit for this assignment.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>About Copying Code and Academic Misconduct</h3>
<p>
For almost any C program that does something useful,
someone has already written this program and
further, has posted it for others to use.
This program does not do much that is useful,
and is not likely posted anywhere.
Still, it is academic misconduct for you to copy or use some or
all of a program
that has been written by someone else.
</p>
<p>
The penalty for academic misconduct on this assignment
(and all CS/ECE 354 assignments)
will be a failing grade in the course.
This penalty is significantly more harsh than if you simply do not 
do the assignment.
You will gain much more by doing the assignment
than by copying, possibly modifying,
and turning in someone else's effort.
